						<h3>Head of Product,  English Language (Literacy & ELT)</h3>
						<h4>Full time / Part Time, London, Start: November 2014</h4>
						<p>We’re very excited to be looking for project/product manager and expert in ELT content and pedagogy - someone who we believe will be a game-changer for our ambitious, young startup. It means we are officially growing up, and you’ll be the one to lead our charge to market.</p>
						<p class="smallFont boldStyle rightAlign" id="more">(Read more)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="details">
						<h5>Skills we’re looking for:</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>5+ years experience working in the ELT and / or primary literacy sector</li>
							<li>Experience in teaching and publishing</li>
							<li>You’ve run teams before, and you know how to get things done on time, on budget.</li> 
							<li>You know what teachers and students love, what they hate, and know exactly how the digital English marketplace fits together.</li>
							<li>You might not have put together your own courses, but you’ve got the pedagogical and digital know-how to get it right first time.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Skills that earn you extra points:</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>a love of making things, whether on paper, in code or with a soldering iron</li>
							<li>experience with assessment frameworks like TOEFL, CEFR or National Literacy Standards.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Mostly, you need to be as depressed as we are about the quality of products out there, and determined to play your part in changing the English learning world for the better.</p>

						<h5>About Tonguesten</h5>
						<p>Tonguesten is an early-stage social enterprise that has big ambitions to change the world of language-learning and literacy. We take the world’s best music videos, films and football, and turn them into learning materials. We believe that the learning materials of the future will be different for each user, and will update in real-time. Whether a student likes Arsenal or Lady Gaga, we don’t care - it’s all packed with useful language that can be teased out, using artificial intelligence, to become part of a personalised course.</p>

						<p>Our first product ReBeats has been in private beta for three months: it’s Guitar Hero for Learning English.</p>
						<p>We’re pretty proud that our users (teachers and students) from 88 countries are playing, on average, for twenty minutes a day.</p>

						<p>We’re backed by Telefonica, based at the WAYRA accelerator in Central London, and we’ve just won a prestigious grant to develop a primary school product for the 1 million + kids in the UK who don’t have English at home.</p>

						<p>You’ll help us to develop it, while</p>
						<ul>
							<li>working alongside our NLP team and educational psychologist to map the national English curriculum onto music videos (we’re not joking  :) )</li>
							<li>working with our design and business team to make data-driven decisions</li>
							<li>getting feedback from kids and teachers who will tell you that you’ve “honestly, honestly come up with the coolest thing ever”</li>
							<li>seeing the platforms you make undergo rigorous scientific trials in four continents</li>
							<li>helping to come up with a solution that could change the game for the 1 in 5 people in the UK and EU who cannot read</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Benefits</h5>
						<p>We offer a flexible working environment with lots of benefits and the chance to work on one of those startups that really does have the capacity to change the world.</p>

						<p>Benefits include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>flexible working hours /  days </li>
							<li>very generous time off (like better than anywhere else you’ve ever worked)</li>
							<li>going with the team to music, shows, exhibitions, hardware hacks (we love Arduino + modular synths + digital art) and hidden little restaurants around London.</li>
							<li>a pretty impressive team if we do modestly say so ourselves (including the former head of UX for the Facebook Mobile phone, Product Manager at Universal Music, and a trumpet-player renegade linguist)</li>
							<li>competitive salary and generous options</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Oh, and if you can come up with a better meme that the baby seals one on our Facebook page we will hire you on the spot!
